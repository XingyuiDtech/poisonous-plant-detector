## The Algorithm

The algorithm was given a few thousand pictures of common poisonous plants in order to attemp to identify them. 80% of the pictures have been used to train the network while the rest is used to test and evaluate the training pictures. It can only identify three plants, specifically the Atlantic Poison Oak, the Eastern Poison Ivy and the Poison Sumac. This algorithm runs on a 4 GB Jetson Nano with the a pre-trained model that was modified to identify these plants.
